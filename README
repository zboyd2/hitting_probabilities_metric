Code accompanying the paper "A metric on directed graphs and Markov chains based on hitting probabilities" by Boyd et al.

To compute the metric, check get_dhp.m.

To replicate examples from the paper, check the files fig_*.

This code should be useful any other users, but if you run into issues, feel free to email zachboyd@email.unc.edu with issues, and I will try to help.

Added code by Or Feldman at Technion
